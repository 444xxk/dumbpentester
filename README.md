# The dumbpentester rocket script v0.07 'passwordy' (pre-release)

## Purpose

Fire and forget script automating the finding of targets vulnerabilities.

Usage:
`./thedumbpentester [domain.com/IP/companyname/maintenance] [targetmode:company/domain/ip]  [scanmode] [*web*] [*user wordlist*] [*password wordlist*] [*openVASurl:port*] [*openVASuser*] [*openVASpassword*] [*debug*] [*noadditionalbrute*]`

## Concepts of the tool:

1. Everything should be automatic.
2. Only open source tools used.
3. Report contains only useful information for direct exploitation.

## Results

As the report function is currently under development, you can inspect results of the script in folder /root/.dumbpentester/attackeddomain.com/

Organisation:
- ips.lst : main IPs list
- domains.csv : subdomains found
- userdir/ : users, emails and passwords found
- vulndir/ : vulnerabilities found
- outputdir/ : results of all the tools used
